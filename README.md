## Background

When I was first branching out from Python and purely data-focused coding, I wanted to build an interactive web application that would handle a decent amount of traffic - what better excuse than my wedding website! If you review the code, you will notice glaring issues, warnings upon starting the app, and a whole host of other issues - growing pains that were important to my growth as an engineer. Maybe I should have cleaned this all up before making this repo public, but you live and you learn! This website was hosted at https://www.marinaandcasey.com, and may still be up if you navigate to it. This template can easily be adapted by a novice engineer that is getting married and wishes to create their own website, rather than use a service.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

This website was deployed manually using AWS Amplify. I should go back and add the [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) code that represents what was deployed, but I have other more pressing things to do. That being said, Amplify is super easy and an excellent way to deploy a website quickly and inexpensively.
