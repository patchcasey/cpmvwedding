                We have blocks at two hotels in Yarmouth and will have a bus to and from Yarmouth, as well as Harwichport if you prefer your own rental.

                <u>Hotel Blocks</u>:
                <br/><br/><b>The Surf & Sand Beach Motel</b>
                <br/>This cute beachfront inn is as Cape-y as it gets. Since the beach hasn't changed since Jawsâ„¢, you must book by phone to join the block.
                <br/>If they ask "who do you know here?" say "Marina Vranos and the Patch-Vranos Wedding". Please note it requires a 2 night minimum
                <br/><b>508-398-2341</b>
                <br/><br/>277 S Shore Dr, South Yarmouth, MA 02664
                <br/><br/><b>The Hampton Inn & Suites West Yarmouth</b>
                <br/>This option offers flexibility and predictability. It also offers a one-night option (not through the block, sorry). 
                <br/>To access the block, use group code <b>VPW</b>

                <br/>During booking, click on the box that says "Special Rates" - this opens a window with options.
                <br/>In the box that says "Group Code" enter code  <b>VPW</b>   then click "Check Rooms and Rates".  The block rates and room options will appear.
                <br/>Note:  this code and rate is only available until July 10, 2022.
