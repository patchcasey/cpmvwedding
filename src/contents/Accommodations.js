                <br/>This cute beachfront inn is as Cape-y as it gets. Since the beach hasn't changed since Jaws™, you must book by phone to join the block.
                <br/>If they ask "who do you know here?" say "Marina Vranos and the Patch-Vranos Wedding". Please note it requires a 2 night minimum
