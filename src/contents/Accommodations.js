                <h2>How to get to the cape</h2>
                <u>Flying</u><br/>
                Boston Logan Airport: Closest airport to Cape Cod. We recommend flying here and taking public transportation to the Cape or renting a car.<br/>
                <u>Getting to the Cape from Boston</u><br/>
                <a className="pageLink" href="https://book.peterpanbus.com/#/">Peter Pan Bus:</a>&nbsp;From Logan Airport or South Station to Hyannis<br/>
                <a className="pageLink" href="https://cars.wanderu.com/">Car Rental:</a>&nbsp;Here is an option to browse rental companies<br/>
                <br/>
                <u>Driving Directions</u><br/>
                The fastest way is to take I-93 South from Boston, then merge onto MA-3 South and US-6 East to Yarmouth, Harwich Port, or your accommodation destination. Without traffic, the drive is about 70 miles and takes around 1 hour and 20 minutes.<br/>
                We recommend checking out our hotel blocks in Yarmouth Port, or getting an Airbnb in Harwich Port in order to take advantage of busses to and from the venue. Check out the options above!
